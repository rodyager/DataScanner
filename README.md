This is a simple project to demonstrate the SwiftUI `DataButton` struct and a `Scanable` protocol.

`DataButton($scanable)`  provides a button to enable the camera to capture of value of `scanable` provided scanable conforms to the
`Scanable` protocol.

Sample implementations are provided to make `Date` and `Double` conform to the `Scanable`   protocol to scan dates and currency respectively.
